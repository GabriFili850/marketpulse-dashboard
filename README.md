# MarketPulse Crypto
MarketPulse Crypto is a React dashboard that displays Ethereum price and gas data in real time, along with a 12‑month ETH price chart. The app fetches gas oracle data from the Etherscan API and uses CoinGecko for the ETH price history, updating on a configurable interval. This tool can be useful for Ethereum users who want to keep track of gas prices to optimize transaction costs.
